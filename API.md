* ```has_location``` - Returns only messages with a location.

# Appendix 2

The *near* feature returns messages whose location is contained within a square with a specified radius. 
This works by checking if the possible adjacent locations are within bounds, assigning them letters and numbers which are then fed into the Message filter.

The *near* functionality uses a recursive algorithm and a stack to keep track of the candidate locations.

Consider a map with 2 rows, 1 block per row, 2 rows per block and 2 columns per block, like the following:

	AA1		AA2		AA3
	AB1		AB2		AB3
			
	BA1		BA2		BA3
	BB1		BB2		BB3
	
In this example, the location ```AB2``` is "near" AA1, AA2, AA3, AB1, AB3, BA1, BA2 and BA3.
